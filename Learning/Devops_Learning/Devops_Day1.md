### Detailed Outline of SDLC Phases

- **Planning and Requirements Gathering**  
  - Initiated by business analysts or product owners.  
  - Collects customer feedback and market research to validate feature viability (e.g., adding a kids’ clothing section on an e-commerce site).  
  - Ensures that only feasible and demanded features move forward to development.

- **Defining Requirements**  
  - Conversion of gathered information into formal documentation (SRS).  
  - Specifies customer needs, target audience segments, feature details, and constraints.

- **Design Phase**  
  - Split into High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).  
  - HLD focuses on system scalability, architecture, and technology stack choices.  
  - LLD breaks down the system into modules, algorithms, function calls, and database interactions.

- **Building/Development Phase**  
  - Developers write code according to the LLD, using preferred programming languages.  
  - Code is committed to a centralized version control system (e.g., Git) for team collaboration.  
  - Peer reviews (Pull Requests) ensure code quality before merging.

- **Testing Phase**  
  - Conducted by Quality Engineers (QE) or testers to verify functionality, performance, and usability.  
  - Ensures defect-free, customer-ready product delivery.  
  - Testing environments typically mirror production, such as staging servers.

- **Deployment Phase**  
  - Software is promoted from staging/testing environments to production where end users access it.  
  - Deployment is ideally automated to minimize downtime and human error.

### Role of DevOps in SDLC

- **Primary Focus Areas:**  
  - DevOps engineers concentrate on automating the **building**, **testing**, and **deployment** phases.  
  - Automation reduces manual interventions, accelerates delivery, and enhances overall efficiency.  
  - While DevOps professionals can participate in earlier stages (planning, design), their critical impact is in streamlining these three phases.

- **Automation Benefits:**  
  - Faster product releases with consistent quality.  
  - Improved collaboration between development and operations teams.  
  - Enables continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.  
  - Helps identify and fix issues early, reducing production risks.

- **Decision-Making in Tool Adoption:**  
  - DevOps engineers must evaluate tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) for organizational fit rather than blindly adopting popular tools.  
  - They act as efficiency advisors, recommending solutions that align with specific organizational needs.

### Virtual Machine


#### Real-World Analogy: Land and Property

- Imagine owning **one acre of land** with a house and various amenities like a park and garden.
- Initially, the entire land is used by one family, but later they realize they only need **half an acre** to live comfortably.
- The remaining half acre is unused and wasted.
- To improve efficiency, the family builds another property on the unused half acre and rents it out.
- Now, two families live on the same land, each using their own resources independently, increasing **resource utilization and efficiency**.
- This analogy illustrates how **virtualization increases efficiency** by enabling multiple independent entities to share a single physical resource.

#### Transition to Software Industry Problem

- A **server** is introduced as a physical machine where applications are deployed and accessed by users (e.g., Google, Amazon).
- Example company `example.com` buys five physical servers of varying sizes.
- Each server is dedicated to a single team or application.
- Many applications only use a small fraction of the server’s capacity (e.g., 4GB RAM and 4 CPUs on a 100GB RAM and 100-core server).
- This leads to **significant underutilization** of resources, causing inefficiency.
- Different teams may be assigned entire servers but use only a small percentage of the resources, wasting the rest.

#### Introduction of Virtualization and Hypervisors

- **Virtualization** allows **logical partitioning** of a single physical server into multiple virtual machines.
- A **hypervisor** is software that manages this partitioning and creates VMs on physical servers.
- Instead of physically dividing the server, virtualization provides **logical isolation**.
- Each VM functions as a separate virtual computer with its own CPU, memory, and hardware resources, independent of other VMs on the same server.
- This approach drastically improves resource utilization by allowing multiple teams or applications to share the same physical hardware efficiently.
  
#### Popular Hypervisors

- VMware
- Xen

These hypervisors enable the creation and management of virtual machines on physical servers.

---

### Virtual Machines in Cloud Computing

- Cloud providers like **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud** use virtualization extensively.
- Cloud providers maintain **large data centers** in multiple regions globally (e.g., Mumbai, Singapore, Ohio).
- Each data center contains thousands or millions of physical servers.
- Every physical server runs a hypervisor that creates multiple virtual machines.
- Users request VMs (e.g., AWS EC2 instances) through cloud portals or automation scripts.
- The cloud platform allocates a VM from available physical servers based on the requested specifications (RAM, CPU cores).
- Users receive access credentials (IP address, keys) to use their virtual machines but do not have physical access to the underlying hardware.
- This model provides **scalable, on-demand access** to computing resources without the need to own physical servers.

---

### Efficiency Improvements Through Virtualization

- Virtualization allows **millions of users or teams** to share a limited number of physical servers.
- Without virtualization, a data center with 100 physical servers could only support 100 teams.
- With virtualization, each physical server can host multiple VMs, supporting thousands or millions of users.
- This leads to **better utilization of resources**, reduced costs, and improved operational efficiency.
- DevOps engineers focus on improving this efficiency through automation and virtualization.
